# 🖼️ Distributed Image Compression Pipeline (SVD + PySpark + Airflow)

This project implements a **distributed, scalable image ingestion and compression pipeline** built using **Apache Airflow** and **PySpark**. The system extracts images from multiple online sources, compresses them using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, and stores results along with metadata in **MongoDB** and **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**. **MLflow** is used to track compression experiments and metrics.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a distributed, scalable ETL pipeline for processing 1M+ images
- Compress image data using **SVD** while preserving essential features
- Enable seamless **storage, retrieval, and tracking** across cloud services
- Lay groundwork for future large-scale image analytics and ML applications
